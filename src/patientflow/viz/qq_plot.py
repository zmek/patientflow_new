"""
This module generates Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots to compare observed values with model predictions in a healthcare context, specifically focusing on the prediction of hospital bed demand. The QQ plot is a graphical technique for determining if two data sets come from populations with a common distribution. If so, we should see the points forming a line approximately along the reference line y=x.

To prepare the predicted distribution
- Treat the predicted distributions (saved as cdfs) for all time points of interest as if they were one distribution
- Within this predicted distribution, because each probability is over a discrete rather than continuous number of input values, the upper and lower of values of the probability range are saved at each value
- The mid point between upper and lower is calculated and saved
- The distribution of cdf mid points (one for each horizon date) is sorted by value of the mid point and a cdf of this is calculated (this is a cdf of cdfs, in effect)
- These are weighted by the probability of each value occurring

To prepare the observed distribution
- Take boserved number each horizon date and save the cdf of that value from its predicted distribution
- The distribution of cdf values (one per horizon date) is sorted
- These are weighted by the probability of each value occurring, which is a uniform probability (1 / over the number of horizon dates)

Key Functions:
- qq_plot: Generates and plots the QQ plot based on the provided observed and predicted data.

The QQ plots generated by this module can help healthcare administrators understand the accuracy of their predictive models in forecasting bed demand

    """
    Generate a QQ plot comparing observed values with model predictions.

    The function aggregates the predicted and observed distributions, calculates their CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function),
    and plots the observed CDF against the predicted CDF to visualize the accuracy of the predictions.

    Parameters
    - prediction_moments (list): A list of time points of interest.
    - prob_dist_dict (dict): A nested dictionary containing predicted and actual demands for each time point.
      The structure is {time_point: {'pred_demand': pd.DataFrame of predicted value, 'actual_demand': integer}}.
    - title_ (str): Title for the plot.

    Returns
    - matplotlib.figure.Figure: A figure object containing the QQ plot.
